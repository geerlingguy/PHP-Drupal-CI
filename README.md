# Vagrant profile for Drupal/PHP CI

**NOTE**: This repository is no longer maintained; I've moved development work to a much more modern configuration; see: [Jenkins and SonarQube Drupal CI and Static Code Analysis](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupalci-sonar-jenkins), which powers [drupalci.midwesternmac.com](http://drupalci.midwesternmac.com/).
